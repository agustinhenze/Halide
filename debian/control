Package: libhalide
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, llvm-3.5-dev
Description: Language for image processing and computational photography
 Halide is a new programming language designed to make it easier to write
 high-performance image processing code on modern machines. Its current front
 end is embedded in C++. Compiler targets include x86/SSE, ARMv7/NEON, CUDA,
 Native Client, and OpenCL.
